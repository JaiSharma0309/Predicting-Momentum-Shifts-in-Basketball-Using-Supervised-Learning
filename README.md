# Predicting-Momentum-Shifts-in-Basketball-Using-Supervised-Learning

This project constructs a structured play-by-play dataset from NBA games to study and model momentum shifts over the course of a basketball game. Raw play-by-play data was scraped from Basketball Reference, which contains a detailed sequence of game events such as shots, turnovers, fouls, and rebounds, along with the game clock and current score. Because this data is messy and formatted primarily for human viewing rather than analysis, we built a reproducible data pipeline that first downloads raw game files, then cleans and standardizes them into a consistent format. The cleaning process removes repeated headers, quarter boundary rows, and largely empty columns, infers the current quarter for each play, separates the score into home and away components, and converts time remaining into a numeric format that can be used in modeling. These cleaned per-game files are then combined into a single corpus stored in Parquet format, making the dataset efficient to load and scalable for hundreds of games.

The goal of the project is to quantify and predict “momentum” in NBA games, a concept that is widely discussed in sports but difficult to define formally. Rather than relying on subjective notions of momentum, we aim to operationalize it using measurable game states such as score differential, time remaining, and sequences of play events. The combined corpus allows us to treat each play as a time step in a sequence, preserving the temporal structure of games. This makes it possible to apply both statistical and machine learning approaches, including sequence models that learn patterns over time rather than treating each play as an independent observation.

In the modeling phase, we plan to build supervised learning models that take recent play history as input and predict future outcomes related to momentum, such as whether a team will extend or lose a lead in the next few minutes of game time. Features will include numerical variables like score differential and time remaining, as well as textual features derived from the play descriptions using NLP techniques. For example, we may embed the play text using word embeddings and combine these with structured game features in a hybrid model. This connects directly to concepts from both supervised learning and corpus linguistics, as we are treating the play-by-play descriptions as a specialized sports corpus while also learning predictive relationships from labeled outcomes.

Ultimately, the project seeks to show whether momentum in basketball can be meaningfully captured and predicted using data-driven methods. If successful, the model should be able to identify patterns that precede momentum shifts, such as clusters of defensive stops, scoring runs, or critical turnovers. Beyond prediction, the model can also help interpret which types of plays and game situations are most associated with changes in momentum, providing both analytical and practical insights into how games unfold.
